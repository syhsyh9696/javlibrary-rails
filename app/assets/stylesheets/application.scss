 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

 // Example using 'Cerulean' bootswatch

 //Import bootstrap-sprockets
 @import "bootstrap-sprockets";

 // Import cerulean variables
 @import "bootswatch/darkly/variables";

 // Then bootstrap itself
 @import "bootstrap";

 // Bootstrap body padding for fixed navbar
 body { padding-top: 70px; }

 // And finally bootswatch style itself
 @import "bootswatch/darkly/bootswatch";

 // Whatever application styles you have go last
 @import "base";

 // Add font-awesome-rails
 @import "font-awesome";
